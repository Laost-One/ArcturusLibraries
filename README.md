# ArcturusLibraries
A series of classes in Java to help with programming.

ArcMath contains methods for performing basic numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm, square root, and trigonometric functions, as well as methods to calculate values according to the quadratic formula and pythagorean theorem.
In short, ArcMath is an updated version of the Math class, with all the same methods, while also containing several other methods that are not featured in the Math class, such as:
  numberContains    -   Checks if the given number has another given number inside its digits
  isOdd             -   Return true if the number is odd
  isEven            -   Return true if the number is even
  isPrime           -   Returns true if the number is prime
  isComposite       -   Returns true if the number is composite
  isPerfect         -   Returns true if the number is perfect
  isLucky           -   Returns true if the number is lucky
  findPythagA       -   Finds the number A given B and C using the Pythagorean Theorem.
  findPythagB       -   Finds the number B given A and C using the Pythagorean Theorem.
  findPythagC       -   Finds the number C given A and B using the Pythagorean Theorem.
